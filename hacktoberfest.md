## The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Hacktoberfest

Hacktoberfest, in its 8th year, is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean. 
During the month of October, they invite you to join open-source software enthusiasts, beginners, and the developer community by contributing to open-source projects. 

You can do this in a variety of ways:

1. Prepare and share your project for collaboration
2. Contribute to the betterment of a project via pull requests
3. Organize an event
4. Mentor others
5. Donate directly to open source projects


#### So what is open source?

Open source software is code that is designed to be publicly accessibleâ€”anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit.
